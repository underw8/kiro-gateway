"""
Profile ARN selection for Kiro runtime payloads.

Since the migration to runtime.kiro.dev (upstream commits 07d24fc, 90d0509),
profileArn is required for ALL auth types — Kiro Desktop, kiro-cli AWS SSO
OIDC, and Enterprise Kiro IDE. The previous gating that stripped profileArn
for plain SSO OIDC requests applied only to the legacy q.amazonaws.com
endpoint and now causes 400 "profileArn is required" errors against runtime.

Falls back to the PROFILE_ARN environment variable if the auth manager has no
profile ARN of its own. Kiro API key auth never sends a profileArn.
